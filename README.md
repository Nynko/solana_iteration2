# Second Iteration on a project

This second iteration was trying to reimplement its own token but this wasn't a good idea in term of modularity and compatibility, but was more performant.

This system was still in the monolithic fashion idea. Because I overthink performance for some practicity (account abstraction + permissionned system) which revealved itsef being a much better solution.
